Planner allows user to create a to-do list based on times from 6AM-6Pm.
Planner saves to local storage using focusout(). Clicking out of the current box automatically saves input. Planer applies color depending on hour block user
is currently in.

past = grey
present = red
future = green

Will add more functionality in the future.
